<p>The Kaggle Titanic problem is a classic machine learning challenge focused on predicting the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic. 
With a dataset encompassing various attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and cabin location, participants 
are tasked with crafting a predictive model. The aim is to accurately determine whether a passenger survived the disaster 
based on these features. The competition furnishes a training dataset for model development and a separate test dataset 
for performance evaluation. By leveraging machine learning techniques,
participants endeavor to create robust models capable of discerning survival outcomes amidst the tragedyâ€™s historical context.</p>
